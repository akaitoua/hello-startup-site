          Getting good startup ideas can be difficult because we often think
          finding an extremely novel solution to a problem is a prerequisite.
          This article challenges that belief, provides a statistical analysis
          of how the best founders came up with their ideas, and gives you 16
          pre-inventive frameworks to help you find an idea that will work for you.

          The printing press, the pencil, the flush toilet, the battery--these
          are all great ideas. But where do they come from? What kind of
          environment breeds them? What sparks the flash of brilliance? How do
          we generate the breakthrough technologies that push forward our
          lives, our society, our culture? See also the popular

          As John Casti wrote, "Finally, a book that really does explain
          consciousness." This groundbreaking work by Denmark's leading science
          writer draws on psychology, evolutionary biology, information theory,
          and other disciplines to argue its revolutionary point: that
          consciousness represents only an infinitesimal fraction of our
          ability to process information.
