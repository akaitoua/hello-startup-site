          to make when creating a company from scratch. Along with this, you’ll
          need to figure out who you should found a company with, who you
          should take money from, what the company culture should be,
          management processes, and who to hire when. Joe Stump will be

          etc.) as well as other critical decisions one faces when starting a

          The Design of Everyday Things is a best-selling book by cognitive
          scientist and usability engineer Donald Norman about how design
          serves as the communication between object and user, and how to
          optimize that conduit of communication in order to make the
          experience of using the object pleasurable. One of the main premises
          of the book is that although people are often keen to blame
          themselves when objects appear to malfunction, it is not the fault
          of the user but rather the lack of intuitive guidance that should
          be present in the design.

          The need to handle increasingly larger data volumes is one factor
          driving the adoption of a new class of nonrelational “NoSQL”
          databases. Advocates of NoSQL databases claim they can be used to
          build systems that are more performant, scale better, and are easier
          to program. NoSQL Distilled is a concise but thorough introduction to
          this rapidly emerging technology. Pramod J. Sadalage and Martin
          Fowler explain how NoSQL databases work and the ways that they may
          be a superior alternative to a traditional RDBMS. The authors
          provide a fast-paced guide to the concepts you need to know in order
          to evaluate whether NoSQL databases are right for your needs and,
          if so, which technologies you should explore further.

          not alter the external behavior of the code, yet improves its
          internal structure. With refactoring you can even take a bad design
          and rework it into a good one. This book offers a thorough
          discussion of the principles of refactoring, including where to spot
          opportunities for refactoring, and how to set up the required tests.

          Drawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University
          Graduate School of Business, Collins and Porras took eighteen truly
          exceptional and long-lasting companies -- they have an average age of
          nearly one hundred years and have outperformed the general stock
          market by a factor of fifteen since 1926 -- and studied each company
          in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined
          the companies from their very beginnings to the present day -- as
          start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations.
          Throughout, the authors asked: "What makes the truly exceptional
          companies different from other companies?"

          flawed-preexisting passions are rare and have little to do with how
          most people end up loving their work-but it can also be dangerous,
          leading to anxiety and chronic job hopping.

          This course is intended to instill a "style of thinking" that will
          enhance one's ability to function as a problem solver of complex
          technical issues. With respect, students sometimes called the course
          "Hamming on Hamming" because he relates many research collaborations,
          discoveries, inventions and achievements of his own. This collection
          of stories and carefully distilled insights relates how those
          discoveries came about. Most importantly, these presentations provide
          objective analysis about the thought processes and reasoning that
          took place as Dr. Hamming, his associates and other major thinkers,
          in computer science and electronics, progressed through the grand
          challenges of science and engineering in the twentieth century.
