      You can validate an idea by using the tools from advertising networks to
      research their userbase. For example, you can use Google's Keyword Planner
      to see how many people search for specific terms or Facebook's Ad Design
      to see how many people have a specific interest. Optionally, you can even
      purchase some ads and guage interest in your idea by seeing how many
      clicks you get.

      You can validate an idea by seeing how big of a community there is
      for it. How many meetups, conferences, and talks are there? How many
      people participate? If you go to one of these events, can you get some
      of the attendees to be interested in your idea?
