          A site built to web standards should adhere to standards (HTML,

          practices (valid code, accessible code, semantically correct code,
          user-friendly URLs etc). In other words, a site built to web
          standards should ideally be lean, clean, CSS-based, accessible,
          usable and search engine friendly.

          From all over the techniques and tools related to design process and

          “deliverables” as Lean UX. Most of the point of view agree in that
          the secret of a great user experiences strategy lies on this tool,
          even so the building process varies significantly.

        image: "personas-dev-impact.jpg"
        description: |
          Personas are portraits of fictional but realistic individuals that
          are used as a common reference point to communicate particular groups
          in your intended audience. Personas are created by drawing together
          the characteristics of similar people – their behaviours, motivations
          and the like – into one ‘archetype’ through which the group can be
          understood. By creating a fictional character to embody these
          characteristics, you don’t lose the little details that make someone
          the person they are. In this way, Personas help ensure that your
          work stays focused on people, rather than an abstract description
          of the group they are said to represent.

        description: |
          The purpose of personas is to create reliable and realistic
          representations of your key audience segments for reference. These
          representations should be based on qualitative and some quantitative
          user research and web analytics.
